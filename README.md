# Election Audit Analysis

## Overview of Project

Tom, a Colorado Board of Elections employee, has requested my assistance in an election audit of the tabulated results for a U.S. congressional precinct in Colorado. I have been tasked with reporting the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. This task is usually done through Excel, but Tomâ€™s manager is hoping this task can be automated using Python. I will be writing a script using Python to generate a vote count report to certify this U.S. congressional election.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Git-Bash 2.32.0, Python 3.9.6, Visual Studio Code 1.60.0

## Tasks Accomplished in this Module:

- Navigate to folders on your computer using the command line
- Read and extract data from CSV files
- Determine the difference between Python data types, like integers, floating-point decimal numbers, and strings
- Perform mathematical operations using data types
- Declare variables using different data types
- Create and use data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- Create and use decision and repetition statements
- Create and use Boolean and logical operators
- Write data to an output file and print the file

## Analysis Results

The analysis of the election show that:

- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.

- The candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane

- The counties in this precinct were:
  - Jefferson
  - Denver
  - Arapahoe

- The county results were:
  - Jefferson delivered 38,855 votes, contributing to approximately 10.5% of the total votes.
  - Denver delivered 306,055 votes, contributing to approximately 82.8% of the total votes.
  - Arapahoe delivered 24,801 votes, contributing to approximately 6.7% of the total votes.

- The county with the largest voter turnout was:
  - Denver

- The candidate results were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 votes, and approximately 23.0% of the vote.
  - Diana DeGette received 272,892 votes, and approximately 73.8% of the vote.
  - Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 votes, and approximately 3.1% of the vote.

- The winner of the election was:
  - Diana DeGette, who received approximately 73.8% of the vote and total of 272,892 votes.

## Analysis Summary

Thank you for choosing me, I expect you are satisfied with the script and the analysis results. This script can also be used for future election analysis projects, and with a little bit of modification the scope of those projects can be expanded.

1. With some modifications this script can be used for analyzing elections on any level the user desires. And the output can be adjusted and reformatted to reflect the same quality of information at the federal, state, and local levels.

2. The script can also be modified to function with data sets of various formats. The script modifications would account for the data set format, and adjust it accordingly to avoid any issues in the analysis results.
